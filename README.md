# KatAM-Object-Editor
A basic object editor for Kirby and the Amazing Mirror (supports all versions of the game)

This tool allows you to easily edit the parameters of objects in Kirby and the Amazing Mirror aswell as the object in levels (so level editing is now partially real lmao)

## How to use
Download the release, open the .exe in it and there you go!
To edit anything you first need to open a KatAM ROM. To do this click on "File" in the upper left corner, then click on "Open".
The program should now ask you which file do you want to open. DO NOT TRY TO OPEN ANY OTHER FILES THAN KATAM ROMS, YOU WILL JUST DESTROY WHATEVER FILE YOU INPUTTED.

### ALSO MAKE SURE TO BACKUP YOUR ROM. THIS APPLICATION WILL MAKE CHANGES TO YOUR ROM. THOSE CHANGES CANNOT BE UNDONE SO EASILY AND THE PROGRAM DOESN'T MAKE A COPY OF THE FILE. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

Once your file is opened you can now open one of the two tabs and start changing stuff!
